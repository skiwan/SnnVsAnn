implement all noise types

changes load gdf and asci to allow to pass in a noise function with parameters

test above

prepare run experiment file to

run on trained networks AND apply training in the same step, no hyper param search (obv0

    Noise impl

    make sure you have the best models and last models for each subject

    create temp folder
    for each noise level definition
      add noise to the raw data
      run whole data pipeline
      evaluate on best model
      train on noise data
      reevlaute on new models

      (result is 2 experiment setups runs, one for non trained and one for noise trained)

    all are applied per channel seperately


    guassian noise impl
      params
        min max value for noise (percentage of signal)

    white noise impl
      params
        min max value for noise (percentage of signal)

    spike noise impl
      params
        strength of spikes
        amount of spikes added


    burst noise impl
      params
        strength of spikes
        amount of spikes added



    should all noise just be additive? (bigger 0?)
